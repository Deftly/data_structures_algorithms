# [271. Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/description/)
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Implement the `Encode` and `Decode` methods.

#### Constraints
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?
